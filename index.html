            <p>Long a fixture of the Sedona art community, we are proud this month to feature a retrospective of Aza Deere's work in <em>Visions of Light
                    &amp; Shadow</em>. Aza became a year-round artist-in-residence starting back in 1962, when she arrived with "a few dollars in one pocket and few more brushes in the other pocket." Since then, she has gone through many brushes and added
                a few more dollars. Aza's work is known for its sensuous and ethereal quality, delicately mixing light and shadow in surprising and memorable ways. Please join Aza on April 7 for a reception celebrating her life and art.</p>
